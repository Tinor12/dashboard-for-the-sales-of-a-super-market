This project involved creating a streamlined, single-page Power BI dashboard to visualize sales and profit data from the Superstore dataset. The dashboard includes key performance indicators (KPIs) for total sales and profit, a line chart illustrating sales trends over time, a bar chart comparing profit across regions, and a pie chart displaying sales distribution by category. Interactive slicers for year and region enhance data exploration. A custom background was designed to provide a clean and professional layout for the visuals.
